# My Portfolio Site

This site serves as my personal/professional data science portfolio. The live site is hosted via Namecheap and
accessible at [michaelfedell.com](https://michaelfedell.com).

This project is a complete rewrite of my previous site which was written in raw html/css with the help of bootstrap.
In order to further develop my React skills and to improve the flexibility/design of my site, I am building everything
from the ground up as a more modern single-page react app.

The rewrite is still in its early stages as I am currently focusing on finishing school and finding full-time employment :)


## React Docs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
