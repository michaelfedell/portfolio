        A product of southern cooking and hot Texas summers, I’ve spent most my life in Texas and Oklahoma. I grew up in
        the East Texan metropolis of Tyler, Texas, known to its residents as “The Rose Capital of the World” (validation
        pending). I spent much of my childhood playing football, participating in student government, and cramming as
        many science classes into my schedule as I could. I’ve always loved the thrill of solving hard problems and ask
        more questions than I could ever hope to answer. I’ve been driven by my curiosity and love for science ever
        since
        my first science kit. And soon enough, (after some friends told me it how hard it would be) I had decided upon
        an
        education in chemical engineering.

        I found my next home in the Sooner State at the University of Oklahoma. It was here that I discovered passions
        in
        leadership development, organizational management, and personal mentorship. Things like the President’s
        Leadership Class and High School Leadership Conference taught me the value of investing in the growth of others.
        Working with the Chevron Philips Scholar Mentor program taught me the patience and consistency required of
        teachers. And the challenging curriculum I found taught me new levels of perseverance and creativity.

        Though I loved the idea of being an engineer and found my coursework very interesting, I felt that my passions
        and strengths were not entirely fulfilled by the course I had plotted. After working for Chevron Phillips as a
        process engineer at their Polyethylene pilot plant the summer before my senior year, I finally spent some time
        in
        careful consideration of my future career. I kept coming back to the great satisfaction and excitement given me
        by an intro level computer science class I had taken in my sophomore year. The freedom and challenge inherent in
        designing elegant software was quite appealing to me. I thought there was surely some way to blend the pragmatic
        problem solving of engineering with the creative approach of agile software development. I soon stumbled upon
        the
        still-somewhat-unknown idea of data science. A practice that supposedly used cutting edge technology coupled
        with
        good business sense and domain expertise to unlock hidden insights buried deep under mountains of seemingly
        useless data. Now this sounded like an exciting field to learn about. Better still was the state of data science
        at the time. Like a Wild West exploding with new innovations and pushing the frontier further and further, one
        industry at a time. After this fascination took hold of me entirely, I began researching the best options across
        universities, boot camps, teach-yourself programs, and industry experiences. Being rather indecisive, I picked
        them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enrolled in a Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University, took a software development
        boot camp offered through OU’s Center for Creation of Economic Wealth, took a plethora of courses through
        Udacity, Coursera, Udemy, etc. and then interned with a Data Analytics company in Oklahoma City to learn from
        the
        ground what data science and analytics would look like. These experiences have each helped me to ask better
        questions, analyze and iterate more rapidly, and communicate insights more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to explore the opportunities and findings made possible through the use of data, I look forward to
        helping advance this still-growing branch of science as we all learn together, just how powerful the data around
        us can really be.
